def parse_strike_dip(strike, dip):
    """
    Parses strings of strike and dip and returns strike and dip measurements 
    following the right-hand-rule.

    Dip directions are parsed, and if the measurement does not follow the 
    right-hand-rule, the opposite end of the strike measurement is returned.

    Accepts either quadrant-formatted or azimuth-formatted strikes.

    For example, this would convert a strike of "N30E" and a dip of "45NW" to
    a strike of 210 and a dip of 45.

    Parameters:
    -----------
        strike : A string representing a strike measurement. May be in azimuth 
            or quadrant format. 
        dip : A string representing the dip angle and direction of a plane.

    Returns:
    --------
        azi : A float representing the azimuth of the strike of the plane with
            dip direction indicated following the right-hand-rule.
        dip : A float representing the dip of the plane.

def parse_rake(strike, dip, rake):
    """
    Parses strings of strike, dip, and rake and returns a strike, dip, and rake
    measurement following the right-hand-rule, with the "end" of the strike
    that the rake is measured from indicated by the sign of the rake (positive
    rakes correspond to the strike direction, negative rakes correspond to the
    opposite end).

    Accepts either quadrant-formatted or azimuth-formatted strikes.

    For example, this would convert a strike of "N30E", dip of "45NW", with a 
    rake of "10NE" to a strike of 210, dip of 45, and rake of 170.

    Rake angles returned by this function will always be between 0 and 180

    If no directions are specified, the measuriement is assumed to follow the 
    usual right-hand-rule convention.

    Parameters:
    -----------
        strike : A string representing a strike measurement. May be in azimuth 
            or quadrant format. 
        dip : A string representing the dip angle and direction of a plane.
        rake : A string representing the rake angle and direction that the rake
            is measured from.

    --------

    Parses strings of plunge and bearing and returns a consistent plunge and
    bearing measurement as floats. Plunge angles returned by this function will
    always be between 0 and 90.

    If no direction letter(s) is present, the plunge is assumed to be measured
