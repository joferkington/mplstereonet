"""
Utilities to convert between strike/dip, etc and points/lines in lat, long
space.

A stereonet in <long,lat> coordinates:
              <0,90>

            *       *
   <-90,0> *         *<90,0>

             <0,-90>                  

If strike=0, plotting lines, rakes, planes or poles to planes is simple.  For a
plane, it's a line of constant longitude at long=90-dip.  For a line, it's a
point at long=0,lat=90-dip.  For a rake, it's a point at long=90-dip,
lat=90-rake.  These points can then be rotated to the proper strike. (A
rotation matrix around the X-axis is much simpler than the trig otherwise
necessary!)

All of these assume that strikes and dips follow the "right-hand-rule". 
In other words, if we're facing in the direction given for the strike, the plane
dips to our right.
