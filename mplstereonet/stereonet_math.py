"""
Utilities to convert between strike/dip, etc and points/lines in lat, long
space.

A stereonet in <long,lat> coordinates:

            *       *

               ***
             <0,-90>

If strike=0, plotting lines, rakes, planes or poles to planes is simple.  For a
plane, it's a line of constant longitude at long=90-dip.  For a line, it's a
point at long=0,lat=90-dip.  For a rake, it's a point at long=90-dip,
lat=90-rake.  These points can then be rotated to the proper strike. (A
rotation matrix around the X-axis is much simpler than the trig otherwise
necessary!)

All of these assume that strikes and dips follow the "right-hand-rule".
In other words, if we're facing in the direction given for the strike, the plane
dips to our right.

def angular_distance(first, second, bidirectional=True):

    Calculate the angular distance between two linear features or elementwise
    angular distance between two sets of linear features. (Note: a linear
    feature in this context is a point on a stereonet represented
    by a single latitude and longitude.)

    Parameters
    ----------
    first : (lon, lat) 2xN array-like or sequence of two numbers
        The longitudes and latitudes of the first measurements in radians.
    second : (lon, lat) 2xN array-like or sequence of two numbers
        The longitudes and latitudes of the second measurements in radians.
    bidirectional : boolean
        If True, only "inner" angles will be returned. In other words, all
        angles returned by this function will be in the range [0, pi/2]
        (0 to 90 in degrees).  Otherwise, ``first`` and ``second``
        will be treated as vectors going from the origin outwards
        instead of bidirectional infinite lines.  Therefore, with
        ``bidirectional=False``, angles returned by this function
        will be in the range [0, pi] (zero to 180 degrees).

    Returns
    -------
    dist : array
        The elementwise angular distance between each pair of measurements in
